# Joint Inversion of Receiver Functions and Surface Waves Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo

This code performs a joint inversion of receiver functions and surface wave data using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion. This is a Trans-dimensional, Hierarchical, Bayesian Inversion (THBI). 

This code accompanies:
- Brunsvik, B., Eilon, Z., & Lynner, C. (2024). Plate‚Äêscale imaging of eastern US reveals ancient and ongoing continental deformation. *Geophysical Research Letters, 51*(12), e2024GL109041.
- The code was modified from Eilon et al. (2018). See also Golos et al. (2024) and Petruska and Eilon (2022).

## Running the examples

1. Run the example synthetic joint inversion by executing `example_github/RUN_example.m`.
2. Once the synthetic inversion is running, you can modify the eastern US example, applied to real data, found in the `ENAM` folder.

## Dependencies

#### Required depending on your data types

- **Surface wave phase velocity**: Mineos (**contact author for access**). Working on integration with Josh Russell's public version, but it's not ready yet: [Mineos_synthetics](https://github.com/jbrussell/MINEOS_synthetics).
- **Surface wave ellipticity**: HV code from Tanimoto and Tsuboi (2009, GRL). Public release pending.
- **Receiver functions**: [PropMat](https://github.com/brennanbrunsvik/PropMat). Alternatively, [Telewavesim](https://github.com/paudetseis/Telewavesim) is **partially** supported.
- **$H-\kappa$ stacks**, including radial anisotropy: [hk_anis](https://github.com/brennanbrunsvik/hk_anis).

#### Other dependencies

These were placed in the `~/MATLAB/` folder. Refer to `a0_STARTUP_BAYES.m` for setup details.

## Setup steps

1. Update paths in `a0_STARTUP_BAYES.m` and obtain necessary dependencies.
1. Compile codes. 
    1. All Fortran forward modelling codes. 
    1. mex code in the `fastBSpline` folder to speed up spline calculations (optional).
1. Run the synthetic test in the `example_github` folder.
1. For real data applications, use the `ENAM` folder as a starting point. Modify "matguts" and `evdata1_database.m` to load your data from your computer. 
1. HPC
    1. Use the "transfer" folder to migrate code from your work machine to your HPC. 
    1. Modify `ENAM/batch` code (Slurm scripts for UCSB clusters) for your HPC setup.
    1. Use `retrieve_results_example` to get results from the HPC and format them (expect ~100 Mb/station).
1. The `3d_models` folder creates a 3D model from the many 1D station PDFs.

## Expected behaviors

- IO optimization: For systems with many cores, Fortran IO operations need a folder in RAM ("ramDriveTHBI") for efficiency. This should mount automatically.  
- Parameter updates: `update_bayes_inv_parms.m` will modify your inversion parameters depending on your STAMP. 
- `run_one_chain.m` is complex and hard to change because it handles many cases where Mineos fails. Test thoroughly if modified.
