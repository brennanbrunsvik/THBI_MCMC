# 3D Model Inversion from PDFs

This folder can make a 3D model through an inversion of the PDFs from many single stations. The code provided here could serve as a good starting point. However, since this is a post-processing strategy, these codes were not cleaned up before being uploaded to GitHub.

For a cleaned and updated version of the codes (as of 2024/09/25), please contact **Brennan Brunsvik** at brennanbrunsvik@ucsb.edu.
