===============

HVkernel
 - usage: 
 	$ HVkernel < infile > outfile
 - requires an input file with the following format
 	Line 1: lowf highf dfreq           (these should all be decimals)
 	Line 2: dh nlayout				   (dh should be a decimal)
 	Line 3: nlayin					
 	Lines 4 to 4+nlayin:  radius, density, Vp, Vs, qp(1/Qp), qs (1/Qs)
 	

From Toshiro:

Note that for this particular version right after reading the Qp and Qs, I am just putting them to qp=1/300 and qs=1/200.

This program was written for shallow-structure study in the LA basin.

I also use Saito's programs not EOS. It is different from EOS.


The outputs are
frq,er,gvel0,pvel0,zh0
frequency, relative error, group vel, phase vel. and ZH which is V/H.
For a basin, vertical amplitudes can disappear (or even reverses its sign
leading to prograde motions), so I used V/H (called it ZH). I just avoided
infinity.

The input structure is fine but since I needed a much coarser layers, 
the program averages over 1-km intervals in depth.
You can change that easily for finer results near the end of the main program.

I also attached a paper I wrote on this set of codes.

If you have questions, feel free to ask.
