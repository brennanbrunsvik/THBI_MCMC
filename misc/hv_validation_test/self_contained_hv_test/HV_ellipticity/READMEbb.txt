bb2021.11.02. I moved the matlab2HVkernel file directly to the folder (THBI in this case) that utilizes the HV codes. This way, different projects can have different matlab to hv codes. See the THBI matlab to hv folder for more information. MAYBE because of this, we need to keep the matlab2HVkernel files zipped up, or else they get added to a path somewhere and these out of date .m files will be accidentally called instead of the .m files in the proper (THBI) folder. I ran into this problem once but it might not still be a problem.
